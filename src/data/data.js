  "about": "I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia. I am passionate about learning software related topics and making software ideas come to life. I have worked on numerous software projects both school related and on my own time. I understand that a good programmer not only knows the syntax of a particular language, but knows the fundamental concepts of Computer Science and how to apply that knowledge to create the best software possible."
